Selenium Example - Using Selenium with C#.NET to test [newbalance.com](https://www.newbalance.com/) with self-healing selectors 
===============

Automated testing of New Balance web pages with Selenium and C#.NET, featuring self-healing selectors with a bespoke implementation based on healenium. An LLM is not integrated, but can be via the SelfHealingDriver Class.

## Current Tests

The tests now run against the **New Balance website** (https://www.newbalance.com/) and include the following:

- **NewBalanceHomepageShouldLoad** - Verifies the New Balance homepage loads successfully
- **ShouldFindSearchBarOnHomepage** - Verifies the search functionality is available
- **ShouldBeAbleToNavigateToMensShoes** - Tests navigation to the Mens section
- **ShouldFindProductsOnSite** - Verifies products are displayed on the site

## Requirements

- .NET 10 SDK or later
- Chrome, Firefox, or Edge browser (default is Chrome)

## Running the Tests

### Via Command Line

```bash
cd GuiTests
dotnet test
```

### Via NUnit Test Runner

```bash
dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
```

### Configuration

The target browser and URL are configured in `GuiTests/App.config`:

```xml
<add key="DriverToUse" value="Chrome" />  <!-- Chrome, Firefox, or Edge -->
<add key="TargetUrl" value="https://www.newbalance.com/" />
```

## Project Structure

The tests are structured according to the [Page Object Pattern](https://selenium.dev/documentation/test_practices/encouraged/page_object_models/):
